    <h4>
	A programming language is a vocabulary and set of grammatical rules for instructing a computer or computing device to do specific tasks. The expression programming language usually mention to high-level languages, such as BASIC, C, C++, COBOL, Java, FORTRAN, Ada, and Pascal. Each programming language has a unique set of keywords (words that it understands) and a special syntax for organizing program instructions
High-Level Programming Languages
High-level programming languages, while simple compared to human languages and are more complicated than the languages the computer actually understands, called machine languages. Each different type of CPU has its own unique machine language. Lying between machine languages and high-level languages are languages called assembly languages. Assembly languages are similar to machine languages, but they are much easier to program in because they allow a programmer to replace names for numbers. Machine languages consist of numbers only. Lying above high-level languages are languages called fourth-generation languages and it's usually abbreviated by 4GL. 4GLs are far removed from machine languages and represent the class of computer languages closest to human language .According to IEEE Spectrum's interactive ranking, Python is the top programming language of 2019, followed by C++, C and java . the choice of which language to use count on the type of computer the program is to run on, what sort of program it is, and the expertise of the programmer.

		Computer programming language, any of different languages for expressing a set of detailed instructions for a digital computer. Such instructions can be executed directly when they are in the computer manufacturer-specific numerical form known as machine language, after a simple substitution process when expressed in a corresponding assembly language, or after translation from some “higher-level” language. Although there are many 

computer languages, relatively few are widely used.Machine and assembly languages are “low-level,” demand a programmer to run explicitly all of a computer’s idiosyncratic features of data storage and operation. In contrast, high-level languages shield a programmer from worrying about such considerations and supply a notation that is more easily written and read by programmers.
Languages Types:-
<br>•	Machine and assembly languages<br>
A machine language depend on the numeric codes for the operations that a particular computer can execute directly. The codes are strings of 0s and 1s, or binary digits (“bits”), which are frequently converted both from and to hexadecimal (base 16) for human viewing and modification. Machine language instructions typically use some bits to represent operations, such as addition, and some to represent operands, or perhaps the location of the next instruction. Machine language is too difficult to read and write, since it does not resemble traditional mathematical notation or human language, and its codes vary from computer to computer Assembly language is one level above machine language. It uses short mnemonic codes for instructions and lets the programmer to introduce names for blocks of memory that hold data. One might thus write “add pay, total” instead of “0110101100101000” for an instruction that adds two numbers.
Assembly language is designed to be easily translated into machine language. Although blocks of data may be referred to by name instead of by their machine addresses, assembly language does not supply more sophisticated means of organizing complex information. Like machine language, assembly language demand detailed knowledge of internal 

computer architecture. It is useful when such details are important, as in programming a computer to interact with input/output devices (printers, scanners, storage devices, and so forth).
<br>•	Algorithmic languages<br>
Algorithmic languages are designed to express mathematical or symbolic computations. They could express algebraic operations in notation similar to mathematics and allow the use of subprograms that package commonly used operations for reuse. They were the first high-level languages.
<br>•	FORTRAN<br>
The first important algorithmic language was FORTRAN (formula translation), it was designed in 1957 by an IBM team led by John Backus. It was intended for scientific computations with real numbers and collections of them organized as one- or multidimensional arrays. Its control structures included conditional IF statements, repetitive loops (so-called DO loops), and a GOTO statement that allowed nonsequential execution of program code. FORTRAN made it convenientto have subprograms for common mathematical operations, and built libraries of them FORTRAN was also designed to translate into efficient machine language. It was immediately successful and continues to evolve.
<br>Different types of programming languages:-<br>
<br>•	Hypertalk<br>
Hypertalk was designed as “programming for the rest of us” by Bill Atkinson for Apple’s Macintosh. Using a simple English-like syntax, Hypertalk enabled anyone to combine text, graphics, and audio quickly into “linked stacks” that can be navigated by clicking with a mouse on 

standard buttons provided by the program. Hypertalk was particularly popular among educators in the 1980s and early ’90s for classroom multimedia presentations. Although Hypertalk had many features of object-oriented languages  Apple did not develop it for other computer platforms and let it languis as Apple’s market share declined in the 1990s, a new cross-platform way of displaying multimedia left Hypertalk all but obsolete 
<br>•	Object-oriented languages<br>
Object-oriented languages help to run complexity in large programs. Objects package data and the operations on them so that only the operations are publicly accessible and internal details of the data structures are hidden. This information hiding made large-scale programming easier by allowing a programmer to think about each part of the program in isolation. In addition objects may be derived from more general ones, “inheriting” their capabilities. Such an object hierarchy made it possible to define specialized objects without repeating all that is in the more general ones. Object-oriented programming start with the Simula language (1967), which added information hiding to ALGOL. Another influential object-oriented language was Smalltalk (1980), in which a program was a set of objects that interacted by sending messages to one another.
<br>•	C++<br>
The C++ language irlt was developed by Bjarne Stroustrup in the mid-1980s it was extended C by adding objects to it while preserving the efficiency of C programs. It has been one of the most important languages for both education and industrial programming. Large parts of many operating 


systems, such as the Microsoft Corporation’s Windows 98, were written in C++.
<br>•	Ada<br>
Ada was named for Augusta Ada King, countess of Lovelace, who was an assistant to the 19th-century English inventor Charles Babbage, and is sometimes called the first computer programmer. Ada the language was developed in the early 1980s for the U.S. Department of Defense for large-scale programming. It combined Pascal-like notation with the ability to package operations and data into independent modules. Its first form Ada 83, was not completely object-oriented, but the subsequent Ada 95 provided objects and the ability to construct hierarchies of them. While no longer mandated for use in work for the Department of Defense, Ada remains an effective language for engineering large programs.
<br>•	Java<br>
In the early 1990s, Java was designed by Sun Microsystems as a programming language for the World Wide Web (WWW). Although it resembled C++ in appearance, it was completely object-oriented. In particular, Java dispensed with lower-level features, including the ability to manipulate data addresses, a capability that is neither desirable nor useful in programs for distributed systems. In order to be portable, Java programs are translated by a Java Virtual Machine specific to each computer platform, which then executes the Java program. In addition to adding interactive capabilities to the Internet through Web “applets,” Java has been widely used for programming small and portable devices, such as mobile telephones.
<br>•	Visual Basic<br>

Visual Basic was developed by Microsoft to extend the capabilities of BASIC by adding objects and “event-driven” programming: buttons, menus, and other elements of graphical user interfaces (GUIs). Visual Basic can also be used within other Microsoft software to program small routines.
<br>•	Ruby <br>
Ruby is one of the most popular languages among tech startups. Many Silicon Valley unicorns have been built on Ruby, including Airbnb, Twitch, GitHub, and Twitter. Its popularity is bolstered  on Ruby on Rails, a full-stack web application framework that runs Ruby. Ruby is beloved by developers for a number of reasons:-
First, Ruby has an incredibly simple beautiful syntax that allows a developer to do more with less code. 
Second, thanks to Ruby on Rails, getting a web application up-and-running takes less time than in other frameworks. The downside of Ruby is its scalability. Ruby is a dynamically-typed language, which makes it very flexible and great for prototypes, but difficult to maintain at scale. As a Ruby app grows, the dynamic nature of the language obscures the source of code errors and eats up computing resources. This is why Twitter switched from Ruby to Java.
World Wide Web display languages
<br>•	HTML<br>
The World Wide Web is a system for displaying text, graphics, and audio retrieved over the Internet on a computer monitor. Each retrieval unit is known as a Web page, and such pages frequently contain “links” that allow 

related pages to be retrieved. HTML (hypertext markup language) is the markup language for encoding Web pages and It was designed by Tim Berners-Lee at the CERN nuclear physics laboratory in Switzerland during the 1980s and is defined by an SGML DTD. HTML markup tags specify document elements such as headings, paragraphs, and tables. They markup a document for display by a computer program known as a Web browser. The browser explain the tags, displaying the headings, paragraphs, and tables in a layout that is adapted to the screen size and fonts available to it HTML documents also contain anchors, which are tags that specify links to other Web pages.
And according to some developers give their opinions about the pros and cons they find and discover in each Programming Language will present it in this table:-
