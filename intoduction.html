    <h4>
A computer is a device that can accept human instruction, processes it and responds to it or a computer is a computational device which is used to process the data under the control of a computer program. Program is a sequence of instruction along with data.    
The basic components of a computer are: 
• Input unit 
• Central Processing Unit(CPU) 
• Output unit 
• The CPU is further divided into three parts- 
• Memory unit 
• Control unit 
• Arithmetic Logic unit 
Most of us have heard that CPU is called the brain of our computer because it accepts data, provides temporary memory space to it until it is saved on the hard disk, performs logical operations on it and hence processeshere also means converts data into information. We all know that a computer consists of hardware and software. Software is a set of programs that performs multiple tasks together. An operating system is also a software (system software) that helps humans to interact with the computer system  A program is a set of instructions given to a computer to perform a specific operation. or computer is a computational device which is used to process the data under the control of a computer program.While executing the program, raw data is processed into a 


desired output format. These computer programs are written in a programming language which are high level languages. High level languages are nearly human languages which are more complex then the computer understandable language which are called machine language, or low level language.So after knowing the basics, we have different languages to communicate with each other, likewise, we have different languages like C, C++, C#, Java, python, etc to communicate with the computers. The computer only understands binary language (the language of 0’s and 1’s) also called machine-understandable language or low-level language and I will show in my research in the following pages the definition of programming languages and the different types of it and the usage of each Programming Languages.
