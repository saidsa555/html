	  <h4>
I have defined programming Languages as A vocabulary and set of grammatical rules for instructing a computer or computing device to do specific tasks. The expression programming language usually mention to high-level languages, such as BASIC, C, C++, COBOL, Java, FORTRAN, Ada, and Pascal. Each programming language has a unique set of keywords (words that it understands) and a special syntax for organizing program instructions. And I have also present the types of languages:- Machine and assembly languages, Algorithmic languages,and FORTRAN. And ihave also show some different types of programming languages like java,Ruby,Ada,Html,C++, visual basic and Hypertalk.  i also present the opinion of some developers about the pros and cons of the programming languages they use.
